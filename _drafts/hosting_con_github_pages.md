Github has become the premier site for hosting open source software projects. And there's a lot more to the service than simple software hosting. One feature that may be particularly interesting to web developers is its web hosting service, known as Pages. The service only supports static content (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.), but it includes a generous free tier and excellent integration with other github projects. Plus you'll have's git's awesome source code control for all your web site assets. By following github's documentation, you can quickly set up a web site on the github.com domain. But what if you want to use your own custom domain? Github has you covered there as well, even on the free service.

Github documents the process of setting up web page hosting for custom domains in a couple of short posts. Those posts do include the essential information, but some might find them a bit too terse. Having just gone through the process for sathomas.me, I thought it would be useful to augment Github's material with my own experience and perhaps help out other folks in similar circumstances.
